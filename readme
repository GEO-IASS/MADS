MADS is an open-source code designed as an integrated high-performance computational framework performing
a wide range of model-based analyses: Sensitivity Analysis (SA), Parameter Estimation (PE), Model Inversion and Calibration,
Uncertainty Quantification (UQ), Model Selection and Averaging, and Decision Support (DS).

MADS utilizes adaptive rules and techniques which allows the analyses to be performed with minimum user input. The code
provides a series of alternative algorithms to perform each type of model analyses. The code allows for coupled model
parameters and regularization terms that are internally computed based on user-defined mathematical expressions.

To compile, execute 'make'

GSL (including LAPACK/BLAS), LIBMATHEVAL, LIBYAML, GLIB-2.0 and PKG-CONGIG libraries are needed to compile MADS

	GSL:      http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl
	LAPACK:   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
	BLAS:     http://www.netlib.org/blas/
	MATHEVAL: http://www.gnu.org/software/libmatheval/
	YAML:     http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html
	GLIB:     https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.36/glib-N-ary-Trees.html

MAC OS X:
	sudo port install gsl glib2 libyaml libmatheval pkgconfig

To verify the code, run 'make verify'

TCSH is needed to run verification scripts executed by 'make verify'.

To execute, run 'mads'

Several examples can be found in directory 'example' (check the 'readme' files)

Comparisons with code PEST are available for most examples as well (in subdirectores of 'example', check the 'readme' files)
