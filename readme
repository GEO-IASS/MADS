MADS is an open-source code designed as an integrated high-performance 
computational framework performing a wide range of model-based analyses:
Sensitivity Analysis, Parameter Estimation, Model Inversion and Calibration,
Uncertainty Quantification, Model Selection and Averaging, and Decision Support.

MADS utilizes adaptive rules and techniques which allows the analyses 
to be performed with minimum user input. The code provides a series of 
alternative algorithms to perform each type of model analyses. The code allows
for coupled model parameters and regularization terms that are internally
computed based on user-defined mathematical expressions.
