To compile, execute 'make'

GSL, LAPACK, BLAS and LIBMATHEVAL libraries are needed to compile MADS

	GSL:      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/
	LAPACK:   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
	BLAS:     http://www.netlib.org/blas/
	MATHEVAL: http://www.gnu.org/software/libmatheval/

To verify the code, run 'make verify'

TCSH is needed to run verification scripts executed by 'make verify'.

To execute, run 'mads'

Several examples can be found in directory 'example' (check the 'readme' files)

Comparisons with code PEST are available for most examples as well (in subdirectores of 'example', check the 'readme' files)
