To compile, execute 'make'

GSL (including LAPACK/BLAS), LIBMATHEVAL, LIBYAML, GLIB-2.0 and PKG-CONGIG libraries are needed to compile MADS

	GSL:      http://www.gnu.org/s/gsl
	LAPACK:   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
	BLAS:     http://www.netlib.org/blas/
	MATHEVAL: http://www.gnu.org/software/libmatheval/
	YAML:     http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html
	GLIB:     https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.36/glib-N-ary-Trees.html

MAC OS X:
	sudo port install gsl glib2 libyaml libmatheval pkgconfig

To verify the code, run 'make verify'

TCSH is needed to run verification scripts executed by 'make verify'.

To execute, run 'mads'

Several examples can be found in directory 'example' (check the 'readme' files)

Comparisons with code PEST are available for most examples as well (in subdirectores of 'example', check the 'readme' files)
