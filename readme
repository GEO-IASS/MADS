To compile, execute 'make'

GSL, LAPACK, BLAS and LIBMATHEVAL libraries are needed

	GSL:      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/
	LAPACK:   http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
	BLAS:     http://www.netlib.org/blas/

To verify the code, run 'make verify'

To execute, run 'mads'

Several examples can be found in directory 'example' (check the 'readme' files)
